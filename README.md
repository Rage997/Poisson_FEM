### 2D Poisson Equation: Finite Element Method


The repository contains the code to solve the poisson equation with finite elements on two different 2D domains with dirichlet boundary conditions. The first mesh is a unitsquare, the second one is a swiss flag. 

### How to run the code

To run the code, run square.m and swissflag.m respectively for the unit square and swissflag domains
